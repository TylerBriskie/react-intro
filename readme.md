# Simple React App

A basic React app to show some of the concepts in ReactJS

## Setup

Clone locally and run `npm install`

Then to start, run `npm start`

Files will be watched and built continuously until you quit the command

## Concepts

- Compiling with Webpack & Babel
- JSX
- Props vs State
- Lists
- Conditionals

## Tasks to Complete

We've included a few tasks to complete along the way. Here they are:

- Allow toggling the state of a card to be `completed` (style how you'd like)
- Make the form submission update the list of To Do's
- Allow creating a new To Do list with custom title

## Future Steps

To continue learning the React ecosystem, look into the following:

- [React Router](https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-router/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/UsageWithReactRouter.html)
